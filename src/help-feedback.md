# Help

If you are stuck in a certain part of the tutorial, want some advice, or just wish to chat with us, [the GBDev community chat](https://gbdev.io/chat) is the place to go!
The authors actively participate there so don't be afraid to ask questions!
(The "ASM" channel should be the most appropriate to discuss the tutorial, by the way.)

If you prefer email, you can reach us at `tutorial@<domain>`, where you replace `<domain>` with this website's domain name.
Anti-spam measure, I hope you understand.
